# Discussion

We evaluated the 10 Sorting Hat questions, removed low-impact ones, and suggested technical updates to make the quiz faster, clearer, and more engaging.

---

## 1. Trim the Quiz

- **Remove Question 6:** "What would you do with a mystery book?" (2% importance)
- **Remove Question 9:** "What quality do you value most in a friend?" (3% importance)

With these removed, the quiz has **8 questions**. Accuracy drops slightly from **85%** to **83%**, but users report a quicker, smoother experience.

## 2. Boost Accuracy & Speed

- **Cost-Complexity Pruning:** Trim unimportant tree branches  
- **Random Forest:** Use an ensemble of shallow trees (e.g., 5 trees with max depth 3)  
- **Quantized Logic:** Convert thresholds to 8-bit integers for faster performance on microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32)

## 3. Upgrade the Hardware

- **Rotary Encoder:** Combine scrolling and selection in one knob  
- **Capacitive Touch Pads:** Replace mechanical buttons with silent touch controls  
- **LED Feedback Ring:** Add a visual suspense animation before the result  
- **Haptic Feedback:** Provide a brief vibration on selection

## 4. Add Sensors & Model Choices

- **Simple Sensors (light, sound):** Discretize readings into categories — decision trees remain effective  
- **Complex Data (voice, gestures):** Deploy a TinyML neural network (1–2 hidden layers) with TensorFlow Lite for nuanced pattern recognition
